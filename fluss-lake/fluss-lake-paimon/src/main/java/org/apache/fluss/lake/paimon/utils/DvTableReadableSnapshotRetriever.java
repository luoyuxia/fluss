     * Get readable offsets for DV tables based on the latest compacted snapshot.
     *
     * <p>For Paimon DV tables, when an appended snapshot is committed, we need to check the latest
     * compacted snapshot to determine readable offsets for each bucket. This method implements
     * incremental advancement of readable_snapshot per bucket:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>For buckets without L0 files: use offsets from the latest tiered snapshot. These
     *       buckets can advance their readable offsets since all their data is in base files (L1+).
     *   <li>For buckets with L0 files: traverse backwards through compacted snapshots to find the
     *       latest one that flushed this bucket's L0 files. Then find the latest snapshot that
     *       exactly holds those flushed L0 files, and use the previous APPEND snapshot's offset for
     *       that bucket.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Algorithm:
     *
     * <ol>
     *   <li>Find the latest compacted snapshot before the given tiered snapshot
     *   <li>Look up Fluss (ZK lake node) to see if this compacted snapshot is already registered.
     *       If it exists, skip recomputing tiered and readable offsets and return null (no update
     *       needed). This avoids redundant work when many APPEND snapshots follow a single COMPACT.
     *   <li>Otherwise, check which buckets have no L0 files and which have L0 files in the
     *       compacted snapshot
     *   <li>For buckets without L0 files: use offsets from the latest tiered snapshot (all data is
     *       in base files, safe to advance)
     *   <li>For buckets with L0 files:
     *       <ol>
     *         <li>Traverse backwards through compacted snapshots starting from the latest one
     *         <li>For each compacted snapshot, check which buckets had their L0 files flushed
     *         <li>For each flushed bucket, find the latest snapshot that exactly holds those L0
     *             files using {@link PaimonDvTableUtils#findLatestSnapshotExactlyHoldingL0Files}
     *         <li>Find the previous APPEND snapshot before that snapshot
     *         <li>Use that APPEND snapshot's offset for the bucket
     *       </ol>
     *   <li>Return readable offsets for all buckets, allowing incremental advancement
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p>Note: This allows readable_snapshot to advance incrementally per bucket. Each bucket's
     * readable offset is set to the maximum offset that is actually readable in the compacted
     * snapshot, ensuring no data duplication or loss. The readable_snapshot is set to the latest
     * compacted snapshot ID, and each bucket continues reading from its respective readable offset.
     *
     * <p>Example: If bucket0's L0 files were flushed in snapshot5 (which compacted snapshot1's L0
     * files), and snapshot4 is the latest snapshot that exactly holds those L0 files, then
     * bucket0's readable offset will be set to snapshot4's previous APPEND snapshot's offset.
     *
     * @param tieredSnapshotId the tiered snapshot ID (the appended snapshot that was just
     *     committed)
     * @return a tuple containing the readable snapshot ID (the latest compacted snapshot) and a map
     *     of TableBucket to readable offset for all buckets, or null if:
     *     <ul>
     *       <li>The latest compacted snapshot is already registered in Fluss (ZK); no update needed
     *       <li>No compacted snapshot exists before the tiered snapshot
     *       <li>Cannot find the latest snapshot holding flushed L0 files for some buckets
     *       <li>Cannot find the previous APPEND snapshot for some buckets
     *       <li>Cannot find offsets in Fluss for some buckets
     *     </ul>
     *     The map contains offsets for ALL buckets, allowing incremental advancement.
