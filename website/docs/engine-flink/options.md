# Connector Options

The following table lists the options that can be used to configure the Fluss table in Flink, including the storage format, the read/write behaviors.

## How to Configure Options

You can configure the Fluss table options in Flink SQL DDL statements. For example, the following SQL statement creates a Fluss table with the `table.log.ttl` set to 7 days:

### Configure options when creating a table

All the options in this page can be set when creating a table. Once a table is created, the defined options will be stored as a part of the metadata of the Fluss table. The stored options will be used when reading or writing the table.
For example, the following SQL statement creates a Fluss table with the `table.log.ttl` set to 7 days and disables the CRC check for the log reading:

```sql
CREATE TABLE log_table (
  order_id BIGINT,
  item_id BIGINT,
  amount INT,
  address STRING
) WITH (
  'table.log.ttl' = '7d',
  'client.scanner.log.check-crc' = 'false'
);
```


### Dynamically apply options via SQL hints

You can dynamically apply the options via SQL hints. The dynamically applied options will not be stored as metadata of the table.
They will only be used for the current query and will not affect other queries on the table. The dynamically applied options have a higher priority than the options stored in the metadata of the table.

:::note
The [Storage Options](#storage-options) doesn't supported to be dynamically configured via SQL hints, because the storage behavior is determined when the table is created.
:::

For example, the following SQL statements temporarily disables the CRC check for the log reading and ignores deletes for writing:

```sql
-- SQL hints on source tables
SELECT * FROM log_table /*+ OPTIONS('client.scanner.log.check-crc' = '7d') */;

-- SQL hints on sink tables
INSERT INTO pk_table2 /*+ OPTIONS('sink.ignore-delete'='true') */ select * from pk_table1;
```


### Configure options by altering table

This is not supported yet, but is planned in the near future.
For example, the following SQL statement alters the Fluss table with the `table.log.ttl` set to 7 days:

```sql
ALTER TABLE log_table SET ('table.log.ttl' = '7d');
```

Currently, only 'paimon' is supported. Once the `table.datalake.format` property is configured, Fluss adopts the key encoding and bucketing strategy used by the corresponding data lake format. This ensures consistency in key encoding and bucketing, enabling seamless **Union Read** functionality across Fluss and Lakehouse. The `table.datalake.format` can be pre-defined before enabling `table.datalake.enabled`. This allows the data lake feature to be dynamically enabled on the table without requiring table recreation. If `table.datalake.format` is not explicitly set during table creation, the table will default to the format specified by the `datalake.format` configuration in the Fluss cluster |

| client.writer.batch-timeout                         | Duration   | 100ms             | The writer groups ay rows that arrive in between request sends into a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when rows arrive faster than they can be sent out. However in some circumstances the writer may want to reduce the number of requests even under moderate load. This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay, that is, rather than immediately sending out a row, the writer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together. This can be thought of as analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching: once we get client.writer.batch-size worth of rows for a bucket it will be sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if we have fewer than this many bytes accumulated for this bucket we will delay for the specified time waiting for more records to show up. |

| client.writer.acks                                  | String     | all               | The number of acknowledgments the writer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete. This controls the durability of records that are sent. The following settings are allowed:<br/>acks=0: If set to 0, then the writer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server at all. No guarantee can be mode that the server has received the record in this case.<br/>acks=1: This will mean the leader will write the record to its local log but will respond without awaiting full acknowledge the record but before the followers have replicated it then the record will be lost.<br/>acks=-1 (all): This will mean the leader will wait for the full ser of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive, This is the strongest available guarantee.                                                                        |
