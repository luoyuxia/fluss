     * * Generates the initial token or calculates a token based on the server's challenge, then

     * If this method returns `null`, it indicates that both the client and server have completed
     * authentication, and no further token exchange is required.
     *
     * <p>Below are examples illustrating the design rationale:
     *
     * <p>1. **Username and Password Authentication (One-Way Authentication):** <br>
     * - Client → Server: Sends an initial token containing the username and password, marking the
     * client authentication as complete. <br>
     * - Server verifies the token and sets its status as complete. <br>
     * - Server → Client: Responds with success or failure.
     *
     * <p>2. **GSS-KRB5 Authentication (Two-Way Authentication with a Third-Party Authentication
     * Server):** <br>
     * - Client → Server: Sends an initial token calculated using the client's ticket. <br>
     * - Server verifies the client's ticket and generates a challenge based on the client's token
     * and the server's ticket. <br>
     * - Server → Client: Sends the challenge. <br>
     * - Client verifies the server's ticket, sets its status as complete, and calculates a response
     * token. <br>
     * - Client → Server: Sends the response token. <br>
     * - Server verifies the token, sets its status as complete, and responds with success or
     * failure.
     *
     * <p>3. **SCRAM-SHA-256 Authentication (Two-Way Authentication without a Third-Party
     * Authentication Server):** <br>
     * - Client → Server: Sends an initial token containing a random string. <br>
     * - Server verifies the token format and responds with a salt value. <br>
     * - Server → Client: Sends the salt value. <br>
     * - Client → Server: Encrypts the password with the salt and sends the result. <br>
     * - Server verifies the token, sets its status as complete, and sends a signature challenge.
     * <br>
     * - Server → Client: Sends the server's signature. <br>
     * - Client verifies the signature, sets its status as complete, and returns `null` to indicate
     * no further token exchange is needed.
     *
     * @param data The initial token or server's challenge.
     * @return The token to send back to the server, or `null` if authentication is complete.
